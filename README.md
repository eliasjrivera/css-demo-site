Refactoring Codebase for Web Accessibility 
<br>
<br>
Description
<br>
My project's codebase has been refactored with accessibility standards. This will optimize search engine results.
<br>
The project follows a logical structure for semantic HTML elements. 
<br>
Icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes.
<br>
Heading attributes fall in sequential order. 
<br>
There is a concise and descriptive title when you view the title element. 
<br>
All links in the head work.
