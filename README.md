Name
    Refactoring Codebase for Web Accessibility 

Description
    My project's codebase has been refactored with accessibility standards. This will optimize search engine results. 

    The project follows a logical structure for semantic HTML elements. 

    Icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes.

    Heading attributes fall in sequential order. 

    There is a concise and descriptive title when you view the title element. 

    All links in the head work.
